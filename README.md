# CarSurveyApp
The Car Survey App is a simple C program that allows users to input details about a car and rate its quality based on their perception. The program collects various attributes of the car, such as its name, engine, fuel type, fuel tank capacity, seating capacity, and city mileage. Users can then rate the car as "Good" or "Bad"
